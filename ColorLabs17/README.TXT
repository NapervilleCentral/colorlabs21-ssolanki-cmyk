She said that the green was too overpowering over the other colors and that the tan looked too similar to the white. She thought I should try making the bounds
tighter and adjusting the colors

Overall a lot better, but I should try and differentiate the light shades a bit more, by darkening the tan shade and lightening the dark shade.

Adding in the extra details in the face made a significant difference, and now the picture looks very clean overall. The only thing he said was that I
should try and maybe change the shade a little more to make my skin color pop more, because right now I look very unmelinated.

Overall, I really am happy with how this came out, and it ended up looking a lot better than I imagined it would have when I first tried it. I want to play around 
with colors some more, but this combo really fits well in my opinion so I think this is a great final stopping point for now.
